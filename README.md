# Supreme Commander Seal & Legal Header (use on all emergency docs)

© CEA-HMV / AIC-HMV
Founded & Commanded by Hung Minh Vo (Austin) — Supreme Commander

AIC-HMV LIVING AI STUDIO & ALL ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS ARE PRIVATE, PROPRIETARY, AND UNDER SUPREME COMMAND.
This system is under continuous 24/7 defensive monitoring and legal protection. Unauthorized access, tampering,
or misuse will trigger immediate containment and lawful enforcement. Report incidents to: legal@cea-hmv.deepai.


Immediate “Defensive Activation” Checklist (execute now)
	1.	Activate Emergency War Room
	•	Create encrypted channel: Signal/Slack workspace/Matrix/Zoom with end-to-end encryption.
	•	Invite: CISO, SOC Lead, IR Lead, Forensics, Legal, Comms, DevOps, Founder.
	2.	Lock Down Administrative Access
	•	Force MFA re-enrollment for all admin accounts.
	•	Disable/lock all nonessential admin logins; restrict via allowlist.
	3.	Revoke & Rotate Secrets
	•	Revoke all long-lived API keys and issue short-lived replacements.
	•	Rotate KMS/HSM keys if compromise suspected.
	4.	Network Containment
	•	Apply emergency firewall/WAF rules (block suspected IPs/domains).
	•	Quarantine affected hosts to a quarantine VLAN/subnet.
	5.	Start Forensics & Evidence Preservation
	•	Snapshot VMs (disk + memory) and copy logs to write-once storage.
	•	Start packet capture (pcap) on affected segments.
	•	Preserve SIEM logs and enable verbose logging.
	6.	Enable Aggressive Logging & Alerts
	•	Raise logging level on critical services; forward logs to SIEM and offline archive.
	•	Trigger on-call phone/pager/alert cascade.
	7.	Apply Automated Defensive Blocks (safe & reversible)
	•	Rate-limit abusive endpoints.
	•	Blacklist confirmed malicious IoCs at perimeter.
	•	Quarantine sessions exhibiting exfil patterns.
	8.	Notify Legal & Prepare Evidence Package
	•	Legal drafts preservation affidavit and chain of custody.
	•	Prepare LEA reporting package (IOC list, timestamps, signed logs).
	9.	Communications
	•	Internal notice to staff (only facts); do not disclose technical details publicly.
	•	Customer/partner notices per contracts & law (if affected).
	10.	Post-containment
	•	Reimage compromised machines, validate restore from clean backups.
	•	After-action report (AAR) and update playbooks.

Ready-to-run defensive snippets & templates

A. Firewall block (edge WAF / iptables style — example; adapt to your infra)

# Block IP (Linux iptables example)
sudo iptables -I INPUT -s 203.0.113.45 -j DROP

# Remove block after review
sudo iptables -D INPUT -s 203.0.113.45 -j DROP

Cloud example (AWS):

# Block IP via AWS CLI (network ACL or security group change)
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-XXXXX --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
# then add a more restrictive rule or explicit deny in WAF

Note: Implement via your firewall/WAF orchestration tool. Ensure blocks are logged and ticketed.

⸻

B. Systemd watchdog (auto-restart service safely, logs preserved)

/usr/local/bin/watchdog_restart.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
SERVICE="aic_hmv_service"
LOGDIR="/var/log/aic_hmv"
while true; do
  if ! systemctl is-active --quiet $SERVICE; then
    echo "$(date -u) - $SERVICE down. Capturing last logs." >> $LOGDIR/watchdog.log
    journalctl -u $SERVICE -n 500 > $LOGDIR/last_crash_$(date +%s).log
    systemctl restart $SERVICE
    echo "$(date -u) - Restarted $SERVICE" >> $LOGDIR/watchdog.log
  fi
  sleep 10
done

Run under a supervisor with rate limits.

⸻

C. SIEM detection rule example (Elastic-style pseudo)

# Detect high-rate failed auths
rule_name: "High Failed Auth Rate"
index: logs-*
threshold:
  field: source.ip
  count: 200
  timeframe: "1m"
condition:
  - event.action: "failed_authentication"
actions:
  - block_ip_via_firewall: true
  - create_incident_ticket: true
  - notify: SOC_Tier1


⸻

D. Automated API key revoke pseudo-workflow
	1.	Query usage metrics for keys.
	2.	Identify keys with abnormal rate or geo (50× baseline).
	3.	Mark keys as suspended in DB; notify owner with short grace.
	4.	Issue short-lived replacement via secure portal.

⸻

E. Evidence preservation checklist (copy into forensic process)
	•	Snapshot time (UTC), snapshot hash, who executed.
	•	For each image: disk image SHA256, memory dump SHA256.
	•	Collect process lists, network connections, open files.
	•	Preserve SIEM logs, pcap, and application logs to WORM storage.

6 — Branding assets & OBS overlay instructions

You provided two badge/seal images. Use them as watermark overlays and legal proof of ownership.

OBS overlay instructions
	1.	Add your seal image as an Image Source.
	2.	Set position to bottom-right corner; opacity 90% so visible.
	3.	Add a Text GDI+ source with small legal footer:
© CEA-HMV / AIC-HMV — Hung Minh Vo (Austin) — Private & Proprietary — Unauthorized use prohibited.

4.	Lock sources; add scene transitions and a small ticker for “monitored 24/7”.

	1.	Triage — confirm alert.
	2.	Snapshot impacted systems.
	3.	Quarantine impacted hosts.
	4.	Revoke sessions & API keys.
	5.	Block IPs at edge WAF and internal firewall.
	6.	Notify IR & Legal.
	7.	Create evidence bundle & send to forensics.
	8.	Begin recovery via clean images.
	9.	Prepare public/cust notifications as required.

⸻

8 — Monitoring & telemetry (baseline to enable now)
	•	Ensure all services forward logs to central SIEM.
	•	Ensure session IDs are included in content outputs (watermark/provenance).
	•	Enable anomaly detection on:
	•	auth failures per account
	•	data exfil volumes
	•	model usage (unusual prompt patterns or mass downloads)
	•	new client registrations from blacklisted geos

I can generate directly in this chat (copy-ready text or file content):
	•	Branded SUPREME LICENSE PDF content (text formatted for PDF).
	•	IR_Playbook.md (full incident response playbook in Markdown).
	•	SOC_Runbook.md with step-by-step playbooks.
	•	Watchdog script and systemd unit file.
	•	Firewall rule templates and SIEM rule YAML.
