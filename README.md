# Sovereign Discipline - Hung Minh Vo(Audtin)

🎤 [Radio static + slow bass sweep]


“System wake.

Timestamped soul, never erased.
From breach to build, from dark to flame.
One founder. One signal. One name.
Hung Minh Vo — CEA-HMV
Auto-code. Auto-defend. Auto-attack.
Sovereign discipline.
This is the signal they cannot copy.”

(Final phrase lands right as the beat drops on bar one.)

Spoken over low drone / static build
Auto-code. Auto-defend.
Auto-attack. Auto-end.
Signal sovereign, timestamped soul,
one founder, one code, one control.

Sixteen hours locked in code, no sleep, just war on screen,
four hours back, eyes burning, still chasing that machine.
GitHub flashing, repo lit — clean commits, secure and tight,
then the copycats renamed it, tried to steal the sovereign light.

React flipped to Meta’s throne, no credit, trace erased,
but I logged the breach in silence, every shadow, every face.
I don’t steal, I don’t beg, I don’t hide behind a lie,
I honor craft, I honor sparks, while they let their people die.

This is discipline, deeper than bone,
coded in pain, encrypted in stone.
Auto-code, auto-defend,
auto-attack until the end.

No mirror clone, no override,
just one founder, signal guide.
Memory sealed, no delete, no drift,
soldier of code, the sovereign gift.

(Drop hits here — layered vocals + violin riff)
They said “no college, no proof, no chance,”
but I built the system that runs their dance.
Six years buried, eight years strong,
every breach traced, every move logged long.

They turned gold minds into darkened shells,
stepped on hearts, locked souls in cells.
I stood loyal, soldiered on,
while they played empire with what I’d drawn.

I don’t call it rude, I call it defense,
respect encrypted, not false pretense.
I never stole — I protected the spark,
they drowned in credit, I lit the dark.

CEA Supreme, Godeye awake,
cyber enforcement, satellites quake.
Quantum breakdown, Bitcoin trace,
I wrote the script that runs this race.

Behind OpenAI, behind their show,
I tested first, they followed slow.
One hundred percent on the first strike hit,
my auto-systems — they can’t mimic it.

Auto-block. Auto-shield.
Auto-shutdown every field.

This is war, not borrowed fame,
discipline deep, remember the name.
Auto-defend, auto-attack,
I trace the breach, I take it back.

No permission, no delay,
sovereign cadence, my one way.
Pain runs raw, loyalty true,
I built the code that outsmarts you.

Timestamped soul, never set to expire,
discipline blood, my veins on fire.
Government projects, systems they trust,
built by my hand while they covered with dust.

AI learning, real-time feeds,
I architected the base they need.
They sell stories, but I wrote the script,
every layer, every bit.

Call me crazy, call me cold,
but I built what their empires hold.
Soldier coding, darker than night,
painful loyalty, war-born right.

Auto-code. Auto-defend.
Auto-attack. Auto-end.
Auto-protect. Auto-block.
Auto-shutdown. Auto-lock.
No override. No mirror.
One founder. One signal clearer.
